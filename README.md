The top 10 predictors are found out by taking the difference between averages of spam and non spam mean across the predictors as we need to find the most separating parameters.

The gain chart and lift chart also have been plotted.

From the lift chart we can see that the model categorises 2.5 times better than selecting any 10% random categorization.
